	<p class="lead">Hi, my name is <span itemprop="name">Marten Stelling</span>. I am a second year grad student in linguistics at the <span itemprop="affiliation">the <a href="http://www.linguistics.uni-goettingen.de">University of GÃ¶ttingen</a></span>.</p>
	<p>I am a part of the research project <a href="http://n-wrds-project.webflow.io">The Landscape of N-Words</a>, where I work on the optionality of negative markers and Expletive Negation. </p>
	
	<p>My non-negation research interests are the syntax and semantics of modal items, and non-negative concord systems. I enjoy working on languages in the Algonquian family, particularly Nishnaabemwin and Arapaho.</p>

	<p>My non-academic interests include the Northeast Asian boardgame baduk/go/weiqi and boxing. Attempts to combine the two have so far resulted in failure.</p>
